# Extension

This is a brief description of the extension so far.


# JIT Compiler for Python subset provided in C, assembled in ARM
Tasks:
1. Use lex and yacc to build the lexer and parser
2. Built the intermediate (internal) representation (IR)
3. Optimize IR code through different methods
4. Use the IR to profile the code, assemble and store hotspots
5. Generate the binary file.


# Distributed Computing System (Maybe not viable)
Tasks:
1. Connect multiple Raspberry Pis
2. Try to simulate a task scheduler that enables efficient parallel processing
3. Use queueing networks
3. Test and improve time efficiency


# Machine Learning
Tasks:
1. Be wild, broody korea!
